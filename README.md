# CircuitPython
This repository will actually serve as an aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
  The goal of this assignment was to get a servo to sweep back and forth by pressing buttons. I accomplished this by use of my prior code knowledge, asking for help, and using libraries online.

Make sure to constrain your servo angle like this:
```python
while True:
    if btn.value:
        angle = angle + 2
        if angle > 180:
            angle = 180
        print(angle)
        servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.01)

```

### Evidence
Here is a gif made in ezgif of me sweeping the servo back and forth.

I used [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) to make the gif.

### Wiring
Here is a wiring diagram of my circuit.

I used [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to make the diagram.

### Reflection
This assignment was pretty troublesome because I had so technical difficulties which made me have to start from scratch after getting some progress and I was still new to Circuitpython. I mainly used examples that I found online fron GitHub and the resources provided to me to learn how to code and wire the servo and buttons. This assignment has taught me how to run most basic functions in Circuitpython and how to use GitHub and find materials on it online.

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence

Take several cropped screenshots of your Onshape document from different angles. Try to capture all important aspects of the design. Turn off overlays that obscure the parts, such as planes or mate connectors. Your images should have captions, so the reader knows what they are looking at!  

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
